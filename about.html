<h4>Hi, my name is Jakub!</h4>

<p>I'm Czech software engineer focused on cloud infrastructure, container orchestration and site reliability.
Currently somewhere between New York, Prague and Chiang Mai.</p>

<p>I like to work on clean infrastructure, make it easy for other people.
Automation is definitely great but it also deservers respect.
I believe that "too much automation" can be a thing, but that shouldn't stop us from focusing on it.</p>

<p>During my studies I focused on many different areas of IT ranging from
compilers and computer graphics to machine learning and distributed computing.
Therefore the quite broad range of article topics. I'm not going to sell myself
here too much, if you're interested in details check out my Linkedin or CV below.</p>
