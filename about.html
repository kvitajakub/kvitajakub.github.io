<h4>Hi, my name is Jakub!</h4>
<p>I'm 24-year-old student from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brno,+CZ">Brno, CZ</a>. I study Computer Science at Brno University of Technology. Lately I am interested in statistics and machine learning, and I'm working on it in my <a href="https://github.com/kvitajakub/MasterThesis/raw/2f29161d617f0d4b7feec8f9a2a23b557b3583f1/diplomka.pdf">master's thesis</a>.</p>

<p>Since 2010, when I began studying IT, I managed to get a lot of certificates, study abroad in Cardiff, GB and attend computer vision course in France.</p>

<p>I was an intern in Red Hat, in two teams, 6 months each. Mostly QE work on deployment tools and a lot of virtualization.</p>

<p>I also was an intern at CERN - European Organization for Nuclear Research - they have quite big IT department, mostly focused on big data processing and virtualization. I was working on OpenStack.</p>

<p>I like Murakami's books and playing board games, I'm smiling very often and I have suprisingly mean dog, but he still loves me.</p>

<p>You want to know more about me? See the CV below or the pretty social media links at the bottom.</p>
