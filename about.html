  <h4>Hi, my name is Jakub!</h4>

  <p>I'm Czech software engineer focused on cloud infrastructure, container
  orchestration and site reliability, living somewhere between New York,
  Prague and Chiang Mai.</p>

  <p>Currently working at <a href="http://www.vestorly.com/">Vestorly</a> and
  sending their best email newsletter with Ruby/Rails, MongoDB, Kubernetes and cloud
  microservices.</p>

  <p>I like to work on clean infrastructure, making it easy for other people.
  Designing and working on high available systems that are just running and
  people won't even notice failures is very enjoyable for me. I love automation
  because you can almost feel the power under your fingers and things just click.
  But I also respect it as things can go south even faster when you
  mess up, similarly to fire. But that is not a reason to stop.</p>

  <p>During my studies I focused on many different areas of IT ranging from
  compilers and computer graphics to machine learning and distributed computing.
  Therefore the quite broad range of article topics. I'm not going to sell myself
  here too much, if you're interested in details check out my Linkedin, resume or
  my other contacts below.</p>
