<h4>Hi, my name is Jakub!</h4>
<p>I'm 24-year-old student from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brno,+CZ">Brno, CZ</a>. I study Computer Science at Brno University of Technology. Lately I am interested in virtualized environments, statistics and machine learning. Last one I use in my <a href="https://github.com/kvitajakub/MasterThesis/raw/2f29161d617f0d4b7feec8f9a2a23b557b3583f1/diplomka.pdf">master's thesis</a>.</p>

<p>Since the start of my studies, I learnt a lot about different areas, even though if I had a choice, I wouldn't pick some of them. Also I travelled around Europe, which was the best opportunity any university can offer.</p>

<p>I was an intern in Red Hat for a year, in two teams, 6 months each. Mostly we were doing QE work on deployment tools and subscriptions, and a lot of virtualization. I was also selected for the internship at CERN - European Organization for Nuclear Research - as they have quite big IT department, mostly focused on big data processing and virtualization. I was working with their OpenStack Cinder backends.</p>

<p>I like to work on unique products, which will impact a lot of people and improve their lives. I love to collaborate with people who firmly believe in what they do and I want to help them, support them and work on the idea together. I find joy in helping great ideas to emerge, in shaping them and it doesn't matter, if I created them, or somebody else. I just want to be part of it and do my best.</p>

<p>I like Murakami's books, drinking tea and strategic, math heavy hobbies like investing and board games. I also started to do fencing.</p>
