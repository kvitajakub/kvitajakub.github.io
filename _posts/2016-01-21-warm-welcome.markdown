Reasons why I wanted to start this blog:

- I was inspired by this [article](http://blog.uncollege.org/5-reasons-you-should-blog-about-your-learning), which sounds reasonable and useful for me.
- In last several months I saw several technical articles, which described experiments and thoughts of the experts and people in the field were actually inspired by them. Specific example is Andrej Karpathy's [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).
- I am already writing my master's thesis which is similar to writing articles. I can connect those two, even though I am most likely not going to (I am not going to pretend.)
- I realized I'm not very good at fomulating thoughts and explaining things, as I jump around and I am not empathizing enough with the reader, who don't know everything I do. This is more noticeable during presentations, I could work on that.
- It would be nice to practice English writing, as I don't have enough opportunities in daily life to write coherent text longer than emails and commit messages.


## What am I going to write about?

Technical articles about stuff I studied.
Interesting details in my life, which can be useful for somebody else. For example, article about internship at CERN would be nice, I suppose.
I am *NOT* going to write about my personal life. At least not about my beliefs and what I was doing.
Although write something about social interactions could be good, maybe compilation of sources I am using. I don't know, yet.
