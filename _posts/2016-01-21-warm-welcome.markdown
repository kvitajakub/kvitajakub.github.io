### Hello and welcome,
This will be a short explanation of what is happening on this website and my long-term plan for writing articles.

Reasons why I wanted to start a personal site.
---------------------------------------------

- I wanted to have a hub for my online presence, which will be a starting point for showing others what I do.
- I saw several technical articles, written by people (researchers) in the field. They weren't published on a conference or something like that, but that doesn't matter for people, only thing that matters are results. Specific example is Andrej Karpathy's [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).
- I came across an [article](http://blog.uncollege.org/5-reasons-you-should-blog-about-your-learning), which promoted writing posts about your learning to keep yourself disciplined, achieve deeper understanding of studied material and connect with people interested in the same topic. As I am already working on my master's thesis, writing blog could be an interesting way to create better thesis.
- I realized I'm not very good at fomulating thoughts and explaining things, as I sometimes skip ideas, which are obvious to me, but not to the reader, who don't know everything I do. Writing will also improve the way I structure my presentations, as they could be easier to understand.
- It would be nice to practice English writing, as I don't have enough opportunities in daily life to write coherent text. It was very distinct in the first draft of my thesis, which had a lot of shortcomings.

What am I going to write about?
-------------------------------

- Technical articles about stuff I studied.
- Interesting details in my life, which can be useful for somebody else. For example, article about internship at CERN would be nice, because few people already asked me about that.
- I am *NOT* going to write about my personal life. At least not about my beliefs and boring stuff.
- I could write something about social interaction, maybe compilation of sources I am using. I need to think about that.

Currently I invest a lot of time to deep learning and my thesis. Next topic on my list is statistics and I want to do some Coursera courses or similar, which would be a nice topic. I can also write about virtualization and more about deep learning, but that depends on what I am going to work on after my graduation.
